# CokoDocs!

CokoDocs is a modern web-based word processor. CokoDocs is built on CokoServer and Wax (https://waxjs.net). We received support from NLnet for YJS concurrent editing integration. 

CokoDocs is 100% open source and comes out of Coko (https://coko.foundation).

We are planning to take this a lot further and currently looking for various pathways to develop the app. If you would like to know more contact Adam Hyde - adam@coko.foundation
